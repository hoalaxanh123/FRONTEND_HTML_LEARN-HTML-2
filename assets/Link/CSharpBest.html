Since C# is a high level language, it reads somewhat closer to English.

As you step into the programming world, you'll soon understand how vital support is, as the developer community is all about giving and receiving help. Moreover, the larger a community, the more people will be building useful tools to make development in that particular language easier.

Thus, in terms of programming languages, C# has the 7th largest Meetup community.</p></div><div class="language-page__attr-block" data-reactid=".10o2dwkq51c.1.1.1.1.0.1:$2.1:$4"><p class="language-page__attr-content" data-reactid=".10o2dwkq51c.1.1.1.1.0.1:$2.1:$4.1">What's more, Unity is the most popular game engine that is cross-platform compatible, and it has a very large community with over 4.5 million registered developers and the greatest global market share in terms of game engines (45% so far). The Unity forum is extremely active, so if you want to develop games or virtual reality apps, Unity is a great choice where you'd easily be able to get support and also have access to tools built by fellow Unity developers.</p></div></div><div class="language-page__attrs" data-reactid=".10o2dwkq51c.1.1.1.1.0.1:$3"><h3 class="language-page__attr-title" data-reactid=".10o2dwkq51c.1.1.1.1.0.1:$3.0">Career Opportunities</h3><div class="language-page__attr-block" data-reactid=".10o2dwkq51c.1.1.1.1.0.1:$3.1:$0"><p class="language-page__attr-content" data-reactid=".10o2dwkq51c.1.1.1.1.0.1:$3.1:$0.1"><em style="font-size:12px;">Salary information from <a href="https://gooroo.io/" target="_blank">gooroo.io</a></em></p><img class="language-page__attr-img" src="./CSharpBest_files/img_salary_C_sharp@2x.png" data-reactid=".10o2dwkq51c.1.1.1.1.0.1:$3.1:$0.2"></div><div class="language-page__attr-block" data-reactid=".10o2dwkq51c.1.1.1.1.0.1:$3.1:$1"><p class="language-page__attr-content" data-reactid=".10o2dwkq51c.1.1.1.1.0.1:$3.1:$1.1">16% of the top 100 million websites are powered by the ASP.NET framework, of which many might be using C#, so there are some opportunities in enterprise-level backend development.
